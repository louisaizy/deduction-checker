# deduction-checker

I recieved the Gibbons Summer Research Fellowship from Bowdoin College in 2020 to write this web application to be used in my professor's Introduction to Logic course.

The application allows a user to enter a formal logic deduction and will tell the user if there is a mistake in the deduction or not.

To run the application, download and unzip the zip file and open index.html in your browser.
